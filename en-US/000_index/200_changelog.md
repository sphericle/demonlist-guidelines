This archives the various changes the list team has made to the rules and guidelines of the Demon List.

## Changes from v1.6 to v1.7 (3/17/2021){id=changelog-03172021}

- Changed the wording of our [framerate guidelines](https://pointercrate.com/guidelines/eligibility/#fps).

## Changes from v1.5 to v1.6 (1/31/2021){id=changelog-01312021}

- Added statements that more clearly states the importance of clicks to the [key takeaways](/guidelines/index/#takeaways) and [player checklist](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#checklist) pages.

- Removed the guideline about auto sections from Key Takeaways, as it was removed from the full guidelines in v1.5.

- Added RGB icons and Fast Reset to the list of allowed hacks.

- Added a guideline allowing players to adjust their framerate midway through an attempt, as long as it does not exceed their set maximum framerate.

- Added a statement to Key Takeaways clarifying that we only accept Twitch highlights, **not** stream archives.

- Added a guideline requiring records to be on the current version of the game.

- Specified that any record without **orb pulses** requires an FPS counter. Records that have wave pulses but no orb pulses are not exempt from this guideline!

- Added a guideline stating that the list team almost never retroactively rejects records after a guidelines update.

- Clarified that players should send a **NoClip run of a custom LDM** to the list team so we can respond to their request quickly.

- Expanded the texture pack guidelines to prohibit anything that makes the text of the endscreen unreadable.,

## Changes from v1.4 to v1.5 (12/05/2020){id=changelog-12052020}

- Transferred the original PDF document to the Pointercrate website, with similar organization to the [documentation](/documentation). The original PDF is now deprecated and will no longer be updated.

- Removed the requirement for **full** raw footage with the Hide Attempt hack and changed it to a requirement for raw footage in general.

- Given that these rules are now available for everyone on this website, adjusted the raw footage guidelines so that **players need to provide raw footage along with their submission if they have it.** The list team will not be reaching out as frequently for raw footage as we did previously, because it would often result in records staying as "Under Consideration" for far too long.

- Added a requirement for an FPS counter for every record on a level with an "official" in-game song.

- Clarified that if a list demon has a strong LDM built into the level, the list team will primarily consider opinions from those that use it, because it would represent the easiest "official" version of the level.

- Added a guideline that includes a public confession as part of the procedure to turn an indefinite ban into a temporary ban.

- Removed the guideline regarding removing auto sections, as it did not really serve much purpose. To keep the level length the same, players would have to replace an auto section with...another auto section. The level length guideline is now in the Custom LDMs section.

## Changes from v1.3 to v1.4 (10/29/2020):{id=changelog-10292020}

- Added guidelines for [creator lists](/guidelines/listplacements/#creators) and verifiers for list demons, including the various definitions of a “creator” and special privileges for megacollab hosts.

- Added a guideline requiring players to respond to a team member’s request within three days before their record is automatically rejected. Responding later will not penalize players or impact the eligibility of their records in any way

- Added a guideline allowing use of 360Hz only with proven possession of the monitor. This guideline transcends the traditional “hardware vs. software” argument because the lag and subsequent heavy LDMs required for 360fps bypass was determined to be too detrimental for the list to be acceptable.

- Removed the hard requirement of raw footage for first submissions, replacing it with “strong encouragement.” Players that are obviously legit with proof such as streams, a handcam, etc. will likely be an exception. Players should still be sure to provide raw footage with their submissions, just in case!

- Emphasized that records without clicks, a handcam, or a live stream are almost guaranteed to get rejected.

- Added a guideline with understanding that changes to submission requirements may catch players off-guard. The list team may grant a [one-time exception](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#loopholes-and-exceptions) to these guidelines in these situations.

## Changes from v1.2 to v1.3 (8/24/2020):{id=changelog-08242020}

- Added new guidelines for players submitting [raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage) with their records. They fully describe the process players will need to follow to minimize the risk of a rejected record.

- Clarified the [texture pack guidelines](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/#texture-packs) to allow all packs that only change the appearance of the player icons (e.g. ship, ball, wave, etc.).

## Changes from v1.1 to v1.2 (8/14/2020):{id=changelog-08142020}

- Added a guideline that allows Practice Mode records from 0% only with a visible FPS counter.

- Changed the [LDM guidelines](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes) to allow minor color changes whenever the original level causes problems to eyesight.

- Added No Glow to the [list of allowed hacks](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks), since the same effect occurs with the in-game Low Detail Mode.

## Changes from v1.0 to v1.1 (7/19/2020):{id=changelog-07192020}

- Changed the placement time limit from two months to one month.

- Changed the Type I skip example to 3% on Sakupen Hell (since not many people are familiar with Freedom08).

- Added the Hide Attempt hack as an [allowed hack](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks) ONLY with full raw footage or a stream (changed to a general raw footage requirement in v1.5).
